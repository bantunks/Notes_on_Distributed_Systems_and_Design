Stateful, Stateless designs and Caching  --

1. Stateless designs scale much better than Stateful designs. Take REST based designs.
2. Caching data would lead to stateful designs.
3. Stateless designs can find it difficult to handle caching
4. To design a stateless server with support for caching, start with a stateless server, and add caching in front of the server as the first layer. For e.g. a REST based stateless server with a Memcached layer in front to handle caching.
5. In a stateless design, since the worker nodes do not maintain any state, they can handle any request forwarded/directed by the load balancer layer.
